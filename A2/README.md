# A2a: About your group

Q: How much do you agree wiht the following statement: I am confident coding in Python

A: Between 0 and 1 - It's the first time the three of us code in Python

# A2b: Identify Claim

Q: Select which building(s) to focus on for you focus area

A: Building #2406

Q: Identify a ‘claim’ / issue / fact to check from one of those reports.

A: Volume of concrete used in columns for every floor

Q: Write a short description of the claim you wish to check. It could be the same as the previous assignment,
   or if this is too simple you could identify a new claim from the report to check in this assignment

A: We want to create a table with the floors as row and volume as column

Q: Justify your selection of your claim

A: The utility of this claim is to know during the construction part how much concrete is needed, to save time and money.

# A2c: Use Case

Q: How you would check this claim?

A: 1 - Repeat for every floor: 
         1.1 - To check this claim we have to repeat this action for every column in every floor:
         1.1.1 - check the height of the column 
         1.1.2 - check the Area of a cross section of a column
         1.1.3 - check the number of rebars and their area (maybe it's not in the IFCModel, in that case we take the data from the report)
         1.1.4 - calculate the effective area of concrete in a column
         1.1.5 - Calculate the volume of the column
         1.2 - Sum the volumes of the columns
         2 - Create a table that fit the results

Q: When would this claim need to be checked?

A: Before the construction of each floor

Q: What information does this claim rely on?

A: Dimension of the columns and number and type of reebars

Q: What phase? planning, design, build or operation

A: Design and build

Q: What BIM purpose is required? Gather, generate, analyse, communicate or realise?

A: Analyse

Q: Review use case examples - do any of these help?, What BIM use case is this closest to? If you cannot find one from the examples, you can make a new one

A: - 02: Cost estimation
   - 11: Sustainability Analysis
   - 13: Design Coordination
   - 14: Site Utilization Planning

Q: Produce a BPMN drawing for your chosen use case. link to this so we can see it in your markdown file. To do this you will have to save it as an SVG,
   please also save the BPMN with it.You can use this online tool to create a BPMN file

# A2d: Scope the use case

Q: From the ‘whole use case’ identify where a new script / function / tool is needed. Highlight this in your BPMN diagram. Show this clearly in a new SVG diagram.

A:
    
# A2e: Tool Idea

Q: Describe in words your idea for your own OpenBIM ifcOpenShell Tool in Python.

A:

Q: What is the business and societal value of your tool?

A:

Q: Produce a BPMN diagram to summarise your idea. Save this in a folder in your repository along with an SVG of the disagram and embed the SVG in the Markdown as an            image.

A:

# A2f: Information Requirements
Identify what information you need to extract from the model

Q: Where is this in IFC?

A:

Q: Is it in the model?

A:

Q: Do you know how to get it in ifcOpenShell?

A:

Q: What will you need to learn to do this? [Enrolled students only]: add to this excel in teams

A:

# A2g: Identify appropriate software licence

Q: What software licence will you choose for your project?

A:
